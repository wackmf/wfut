<h2><font color="#000000">Introduction</font></h2>

<p>This document doesn't go in to much detail I'm afraid, so if
you have any WFUT code related questions then <a
href="mailto:ob1@planetunreal.com">let me know</a> and I'll
answer them for you. I'll also try to add things to a main source
document, so it'll help cover the other areas of the code and can
be used for future reference.</p>

<p>This class structure works assuming that the UT engine can
distinguish between two references to classes that have the same
name but reside in different packages. There aren't any classes
with the same name anywhere within the WF source code, but if
another mod uses the PCSystem code and has the package loaded in
memory when WF is loaded by the Engine, then there would be two
classes with the same (but within different packages) in memory.
As I see things, this shouldn't cause any problems as <font
size="2" face="Courier New">class'ModOne.SomeClass'</font> is a
different class than <font size="2" face="Courier New">class'ModTwo.SomeClass'</font>
and would have different type identifiers. If it turns out that
this doesn't work and would cause problems if implemented this
way, then I'll add 'WF_' to each of the class names which <em><strong>will</strong></em>
work.</p>

<p>These are the current WF packages: </p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>WFMedia</strong> -- Contains all imported sounds,
        meshes, and textures for WF.</li>
    <li><strong>WFData</strong> -- Contains animation data for
        the DPMS code.</li>
    <li><strong>WFSystem</strong> -- This contains all the
        PCSystem code. I created a separate package for it
        because I figured that it would slow down the compile
        time of the main WF source code otherwise.</li>
    <li><strong>WFCode</strong> -- This is where all the main WF
        game related code and content (game critical items, game
        code, etc.) is localted.</li>
    <li><strong>WFWeapons</strong> -- Contains all the code for
        the WF weapons. This package might be merged with <em>WFCode</em>
        or <em>WFPlayerClasses</em> before release.</li>
    <li><strong>WFPlayerClasses</strong> -- Player class related
        code; PCI for each class, online help, abilities, and
        items.</li>
    <li><strong>WFMenu</strong> -- Configuration and setup menus
        used by the game code.</li>
</ul>

<p>Add any new WF game related related classes to the <em>WFCode</em>
package, and player class related code to WFPlayerClasses</p>

<p>The Recon's <font color="#0000A0"><em>HUDInfo</em></font>
extended hud class makes use of the <strong>ITSHUD</strong> code
by Mac and Mek from <a
href="http://www.planetunreal.com/unrealistic/">Unrealistic</a>
for the targeting brakets. To use the ITSHUD code in a <font
color="#0000A0"><em>HUDInfo</em></font> class, sub-class <font
color="#0000A0"><em>ITSHUDInfo</em></font>.</p>

<h2><font color="#000000">Compiling the WF Packages</font></h2>

<p>Extract each of the source file zips to the UT folder so that
the files are extracted to
&quot;&lt;UT&gt;\&lt;zip-name&gt;\&quot; using folder names where
&lt;UT&gt; is the path to the UT folder. For example, you'd
extract files in <em>WFMedia</em> to
&quot;&lt;UT&gt;\WFMedia\&quot; making sure that you use folder
names when extracting the files.</p>

<p>Add the packages <em>&quot;UnrealTournament.ini&quot;</em> in
this order to compile them correctly:</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">EditPackages=WFMedia<br>
EditPackages=WFData</font><font face="Courier New"><br>
</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">EditPackages=WFSystem<br>
EditPackages=WFCode</font><font face="Courier New"><br>
</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">EditPackages=WFWeapons</font><font
face="Courier New"><br>
</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">EditPackages=WFPlayerClasses<br>
EditPackages=WFMenu</font></p>

<p>Make sure that <em>WFCode.int</em> and <em>WFPlayerClasses.int
</em>is in UT's <em>&quot;System&quot;</em> folder to get the
Weapons Factory game to show up in the UT game menu and so that
the default class list to show up.</p>

<h2><font color="#000000">Bot Support Notes</font></h2>

<p>There is currently no bot support for the PCSystem. I've
created PCSystem bot classes with the variables needed for the
player class system, but as yet there is no AI support for the
PCI (the PlayerClassInfo class). I'm still thinking about the
best way to implement it: either have a separate behaviour info
class as a variable for each of the PCI classes which can then be
queried by the bot class, or have the actual AI functions in the
PCI class itself which can then be called by the bot.</p>

<p>There is enough support at the moment to enable bots to know
what items they are able to collect, but no player class specific
AI has been added yet.</p>

<h2>Player class system notes</h2>

<p><font size="4"><em><strong>Important classes:</strong></em></font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New"><strong>[PlayerClassInfo]<br>
</strong></font>This is the main focal point for the PCSystem
code. It's where all the player class related information is
defined; starting armor, health, max health, inventory, mesh
info, skin, sound info, etc. There are also a number of game
hooks to further modify a player, major game notifications (eg. a
&quot;TakeDamage&quot; notification), a function used for
handling special abilities, and functions to do with inventory
collection that can be used to prevent a player from collecting
items.</p>

<p><font face="Courier New"><strong>[WFPlayerClassInfo]<br>
</strong></font>Super-class of the WF player classes. The current
player classes are: <font color="#0000A0"><em>WFEngineer</em></font>,
<font color="#0000A0"><em>WFRecon</em></font>, <font
color="#0000A0"><em>WFInfiltrator</em></font>, <font
color="#0000A0"><em>WFSniper</em></font>, <font color="#0000A0"><em>WFCyborg</em></font>,
<font color="#0000A0"><em>WFGunner</em></font>, <font
color="#0000A0"><em>WFPyrotech</em></font>, <font color="#0000A0"><em>WFFieldMedic</em></font>,
<font color="#0000A0"><em>WFDemoman</em></font>, <font
color="#0000A0"><em>WFMarine</em></font>.</p>

<p><font face="Courier New"><strong>[PCIList]<br>
</strong></font>This is used to list all the player class types
that are used in game. When creating a new set of player classes,
list them in a <font color="#0000A0"><em>PCIList.uc</em></font>
sub-class and modify WFGame so that it uses the list (<font
color="#0000A0"><em>PCIList.uc</em></font> and <font
color="#0000A0"><em>TestClassList.uc</em></font> for more info on
this). Or you can create a plug-in class definition by adding the
following to the packages .int file:</p>

<p>[Public]<br>
Object=(Name=PackageName.ClassName,Class=Class,MetaClass=WFSystem.PCIList,Description=&quot;ListName&quot;)</p>

<p>'PackageName.ClassName' is the name of the class list, eg.
'MyPackage.MyClassDefList'. The description is the name of the
class list that appears on the menu.</p>

<p>This means that this class definition list can be selected
from the Settings tab before starting a game. Take a look at <font
color="#0000A0"><em>WFSettingsCWindow.uc</em></font> for more
information plug-in class definitions.</p>

<p>The <em>WFPlayerClasses</em> package has a class list for the
WF player classes (<font color="#0000A0"><em>WFPlayerClassList.uc</em></font><font
color="#000000">) which is used by default.</font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New"><strong>[WFPlayer]<br>
</strong></font>If anything needs to be added to the player class
like special execs, vars, extra functions or states, then add
them here. If need be they can be added to the PCSystemPlayer
class later.</p>

<p><font face="Courier New"><strong>[WFGame]<br>
</strong></font>Add/change game related stuff here. This class
extends <font color="#0000A0"><em>PCSystemCTFGame.uc</em></font>
which extends the CTFGame game class to gain the functionality of
the CTF game type.</p>

<p><font face="Courier New"><strong>[WFPlayerStatus]<br>
</strong></font>This is the super class of the WF player status
effects. These are for when a player is: concussed, infected, on
fire, disguised, frozen, etc.</p>

<p><font size="4"><em><strong>Brief Class reference:</strong></em></font>
</p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="4"><em><strong>WFMedia:</strong></em></font></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    <p><font face="Courier New"><strong>[WFMediaInfo]<br>
    </strong></font>Abstract super-class of the media import
    classes. Sub-class this when importing new media for WF, eg.
    meshes, sound effects, textures, etc.</p>

    <p><font face="Courier New"><strong>[DPMSInfo]<br>
    </strong></font>Super-class of all DPMS info classes (an
    abstract class that doesn't implement any functionality).</p>
    <p><font face="Courier New"><strong>[DPMSPlayerWindow]<br>
    </strong></font>This is a player setup window that supports
    both DPMS and standard UT player classes. It replaces the
    usual UT player setup window when logging into a game using a
    DPMS player type class. It functions in <em>exactly</em> the
    same way as the normal player setup window. The only thing it
    really does is make sure that the setup window displays the
    players current mesh and skin setup properly if the player is
    currently a DPMS player class, otherwise it acts as normal.</p>
    <p><font face="Courier New"><strong>[DPMSPlayerSetupClient]<br>
    </strong></font>This is the window class that actually adds
    the support for DPMS player classes to the player setup
    window, the other <font size="2" face="Courier New">DPMSPlayer&lt;name&gt;</font>
    window classes are only really used to launch this window.</p>

    just yet. Its an un-implemented part of the PCSystem. See the

<h2>Scripting notes</h2>

<p>If possible, try to avoid modifying the PCSystem classes
directly. Instead, implement the changes in a sub-class. If it is
something that <em>really</em> needs to be implemented in one of
the PCSystem super-classes, then its ok just as long as you keep
track of the things that are changed. The PCSystem code can <em>always</em>
be improved with new features :o)</p>

<p>Use the <em>health</em> and <em>maxhealth</em> variables when
sub-classing PlayerClassInfo for new player classes to specify
how much health players are allowed. The <em>health</em> var is
how much health the player normally has when respawning or that
can be reached by collecting normal health boxes, and <em>maxhealth</em>
is the maximum possible health that the player class can reach by
collecting health vials or by collecting the super-health.</p>

<p>I'll be doing the main builds and integrating the code, so
send any code with some from of brief documentation so I can
merge it with the main WFUT code properly -- especially if
modifications were made to an existing WFUT class :o)</p>

<h2>Typical Game Flow</h2>
